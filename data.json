We will remove reported member content that a\nreasonable and objective observer would believe constitutes or evidences \nsuch activity. We may also remove the accounts of members who use our\nplatform in this way.<p>Sometimes the law properly requires us to exclude content from our\nplatform once it is reported to us or to our Community Jury—content we\nwould make it a priority to exclude anyway. Obvious examples include:\nchild sexual abuse material, content posted by or on behalf of terrorist\norganizations, intellectual property theft.<p>However, even when the law may not require us to flag or remove reported\ncontent, or to ban a member, we will nonetheless do so when we deem it\nnecessary to prevent our services from being used by someone in the\ncommission of a crime or civil tort—particularly when these are likely to\ninterfere with our mission of providing a welcoming, nonpartisan Public\nSquare.

The only time the left wing was up in arms against Twitter was when their bot&#x2F;fake&#x2F;pseudonym-based accounts were deleted and they trended #StopTheLeftPurge. No prominent left winger was banned. No account of any prominent left winger who called for assassination of Trump was banned. Most prominent left wingers were left alone with just a rap on their knuckle after they posted incendiary tweets (some of them were even anti-semetic). And those who posted anti-semetic tweets were Congressmen&#x2F;women. Not some lunatic with zero followers and with low engagement tweets. If a prominent Right wing account had posted something similar they would have gotten an insta-ban. That ex-PM of Malaysia literally called for genocide of millions of French. Was his account banned? Nope. After that there have been multiple terror attacks in France. If Trump&#x27;s speech can be linked to US Capitol violence then why can&#x27;t the ex-PM of Malaysia&#x27;s tweet be linked to the series of terror attacks that put France on the edge? See the dichotomy?<p>Do you have evidence of any prominent Left wing personality being banned from Twitter? I can give you examples of hundreds of prominent Right wing personalities purged from Twitter. Name one prominent left wing personality who was banned from Twitter.

The problem is that they feel they&#x27;re being shut down or invaded or whatever, when they attempt to build their own services and communities. Their responses has been to double down and create even broader spaces going from small groups to alternative social media, and I think, eventually an alternate society and political system. At that point the legitimacy of the US government will be challenged, and that&#x27;s already beginning to happen, and we may have a civil conflict.<p>They&#x27;ve been creating smaller more exclusive communities for years. They have their own youtube news and fan&#x2F;media channels, they have their own internet personalities and figureheads even among the mainstream (like dr disrespect, who seemed to be popular with right-leaning gamers I know), they tend to congregate in various indie games (especially war and FPS games), they have their own forums and online spaces (e.g. private discords; thedonald reddit clone, alternate subreddits; parler; 4chan, which is older than any of this but decidedly more right wing nowadays than I remember 10 years ago), and so forth. The problem is that they feel these spaces and communities are under attack. Parler, while I don&#x27;t disagree with the right of FAANG companies to decouple from parler, is just the latest space that&#x27;s &quot;under attack&quot;.<p>This isn&#x27;t unique to Parler, I&#x27;ve seen the right complain about this in gaming, movies and comics (like Star Wars), tabletop games, etc. for years and I know people who were otherwise apolitical but shifted to the right because they felt their hobbies and fanbases were being (unfairly) criticized and changed by outsiders specifically from the left-wing who don&#x27;t appreciate the original characteristics. And I even agree to some degree that it&#x27;s hard to have your own space without being attacked. For example, recently I am somewhat aware that Hololive idols, basically asian&#x2F;japanese game and lifestyle streamers using 3D avatars, have been under (what I think is) undue scrutiny from some feminists for being sexist, pandering to pedophiles, and fueling misogyny. I&#x27;ve seen similar attacks on anime and on some games. Personally I think there&#x27;s more of a racial element, given western phobia towards asians, in a lot of these attacks and criticisms because extra criticism seem to be targeted at japanese or asian media, but in any case, people on the right think it&#x27;s mostly political and the political divide has not only worsened it&#x27;s caused people to take sides and move from a localized feuds (fighting over media like anime and Star Wars) to a broader battle (politics, values, belief systems). And as far as I&#x27;ve observed, this tracks with their attempts and successes at creating increasingly broader alternative platforms. From having their own spaces within larger communities to creating alternative platforms, like parler, or hijacking sites like 4chan, and actually making them viable, unlike earlier attempts (like voat). As of January 6 I think we&#x27;ve come to the point where enough people have aligned politically on the right that they&#x27;re going to want their own real world society, and not just an online one. Shutting down parler is just going to accelerate the sentiment imo, because as far as I&#x27;ve seen people kind of quantize their world views when (they believe) they&#x27;re under attack, and group up. They don&#x27;t become more understanding and broader minded, they become more tribal.<p>So if the right wants their own society just let them have it before internet fights become real ones. Personally I think it&#x27;s still a small amount of people, my experiences are just anecdotal based on what I&#x27;ve seen in communities I was part of and people I know, but I think the sentiment is growing rapidly and trying to shut things down isn&#x27;t working, at best it&#x27;s a roadblock that pushes problems down the road, at worst it makes people go underground and become more competent at hiding in plain sight.<p>edit: My fear in particular is that they&#x27;ll resort to wide scale political, maybe racial, violence. Not that they want right-wing spaces. I&#x27;m asian, a lot of us already kind of self-segregate and I don&#x27;t see any issue with it to be frank. I know integration is important in the US but I don&#x27;t see a problem with people wanting their own safe space where they&#x27;re left alone, although it&#x27;s sad it&#x27;s come to the point where people attack the capitol.","children":[{"id":25719736,"name":"mrtesthah","value":2,"text":"It&#x27;s probably impossible for the right-wing to create their own society, because they&#x27;re geographically and economically mixed in with the rest of the country.

If you take right-wing talking points at face value, what we have now is a shaky middle ground, a society wherein the powers that be both reject them and also employ regulations that make it difficult for newcomers to make their own banks, lay internet cables, etc. which is why you see right wing memes about &quot;make your own google, make your own banks, etc&quot;. And these aren&#x27;t new talking points, one of Trump&#x27;s promises going into his presidency was to get rid of as many regulations as he could in general: financial and economic, environmental, governance, etc. and democrats&#x2F;the left are usually blamed for loving regulations.

Perhaps such mainstream publications should try harder to do this.</i><p>I&#x27;m not really disagreeing but I think we&#x27;re past the point where publications matter. Social media has created this new world where you&#x27;re able to discover people you didn&#x27;t even know existed. In the past you might know your neighbors and accordingly, you&#x27;d move to a neighborhood that suited your tastes. For example, that&#x27;s basically what white flight was (I&#x27;m trying to be brief, not insensitive), it&#x27;s real, that&#x27;s how people act. And they&#x27;d remain in their local bubble and only have a vague idea of the rest of the world, neatly summarized by the news. People would get mad at ideas and vague demographics, and occasionally figureheads like politicians and public businessmen.<p>Now, on &quot;public&quot; social media like twitter, you can find virtually anyone who has a certain belief or is a certain way and just yell at them for existing or thinking a certain way. You and your friends can pick them out for doing something and mob them on social media, dox them and get them fired, and attack every social aspect of their life. This isn&#x27;t even unique to politics per se, this happened to a woman who made a terrible joke about AIDS and Africa, among many other people for non-political reasons like being accused of crimes or plagiarizing art. And this is in ADDITION to getting mad at ideas and demographics and figureheads. So the divide that used to be vague has been refined to an individual level, and to make things worse people categorize each other and place them into enemy tribes based on beliefs and people they follow on social media. You follow Biden on twitter? You&#x27;re a &quot;demoncrat&quot; and you&#x27;re the enemy. If you follow Trump you&#x27;re a &quot;nazi&quot; and you&#x27;re the enemy. You liked some youtuber personality that&#x27;s this way or another and you&#x27;re automatically a SJW or a white supremacist, etc. It&#x27;s borderline impossible to escape and you don&#x27;t even have to be a part of social media anymore, it&#x27;s become somewhat normalized to pick individuals out for their wrong doings and have an online mob use any means of communication they can, not just the internet, to attack you. You&#x27;re unfortunately suspected of being the Boston Bomber because some guy saw bad photos and created a psychotic conspiracy that put you in the middle? A literal international mob from around the world is coming to harass your family and make them miserable even though you&#x27;d been dead before the event occurred. Now, mobs certainly happened in the past at smaller, local levels, and they did target individuals often to even worse effect (e.g. lynching), but the digital space has made discovery of individuals easier than ever before and made it borderline impossible to hide your presence.<p>edit: formatting"}]},{"id":25719119,"name":"AnHonestComment","value":1,"text":"I appreciate the thoughtful response.<p>I would say that Q Shaman photo-op is the right wing response to far left protests staging dramatic photos with the police all summer.<p>My summary:<p>Left: “Look, we can bully the police and people will cheer!”<p>Right: “We can touch <i>you</i> anytime, anywhere.”<p>Left: “Shut the FUCK UP!”<p>My fear is it’s not going to stop.<p>Star Wars, something so universal I saw xwing graffiti in Cancun, MX has been purposefully debased by people like Kathleen Kennedy — to astroturfed praise from corporate media.

At the end of the day, I do hold them to a different standard, even if I don&#x27;t have a fully logical argument for why.<p>I&#x27;m satisfied enough with three reasons, though none represent a fully logical argument.<p>First, they have very limited scope. Every game console does one thing: play games. Some game consoles do a second thing: watch movies and tv. There are platform features to support those goals (parties, voice chat, friends, etc), but that&#x27;s effectively it.<p>In comparison, phones have undefined potential scope. They&#x27;re used for everything anyone could need computing for, usually only limited by the screen size, input systems, processing power, and in the iPhone&#x27;s case, Apple&#x27;s 2010s attitude about what your phone is for.<p>Second, that limited scope described above is wholly &quot;non-critical infrastructure&quot;. I love gaming; definitely more than most people. I have a Series X and a PS5 sitting next to my TV, while I&#x27;m typing this on a PC with a RTX 2070. Gaming can lead to some very powerful, life-changing moments for some people, and its been a godsend during this pandemic for many. But, its still Just Gaming.<p>I would define both Communication and News, among others, as computing scopes which are critical infrastructure; these are both things people use their phones for, and they&#x27;re both scopes which Apple has a demonstrated history of assaulting on the iPhone.<p>Third, there&#x27;s very little conversation from actual stakeholders concerning game consoles changing. I try to keep apprised with the games industry, and by extension how game developers feel about the major platforms; the discussion about Microsoft, Sony, or Nintendo opening their platforms simply isn&#x27;t happening. While they do have final control over what is allowed to be played on each console, even with the physical disc market, there&#x27;s very few incidents of them abusing that control to restrict distribution of a game that desired distribution on each console. There certainly are games which haven&#x27;t even attempted approval and would be shut down (steam has many anime porn games like this), but the problem certainly isn&#x27;t as severe as on iOS (due to the limited scope, combined with specialized development skillset, combined with individual investment necessary to get a game working on each platform, I imagine).<p>There&#x27;s a second argument, the Fortnite one, that secondary marketplaces aren&#x27;t just necessary for freedom of speech, but also for revenue. All of these companies force games to use their IAP frameworks, which I&#x27;m sure takes something around 30%. Its definitely strange to me that Epic railed against Apple for the same policies they accept freely on Xbox, PS4, and Switch, and I have a less cogent explanation for this; either (1) they should be fine paying that tax to gain access to the platform, or (2) they shouldn&#x27;t be, and thus should take issue with every platform exerting that control. Unfortunately, the reality is probably (3) Sony owns 2% of Epic, Epic cuts special deals with every platform, and those deals have kept them happy for now, despite not applying to the majority of game developers, and Apple is actually in the right on this specific issue in never giving special deals.<p>Its important to remember that the way Apple and Google treat game developers is, frankly, garbage. That previous statement I made about Apple never giving special deals actually isn&#x27;t true: Amazon uses their own IAP framework for digital purchases on Kindle and Prime Video. Fortnite is definitely the same scale as these use cases, but they couldn&#x27;t negotiate a special deal. Google allows applications to use whatever IAP framework they want (IIRC), but not Games; Games have to use Google&#x27;s 30% tax IAP framework. Due to these policies, Google and Apple are both Top 5 &quot;Gaming Companies&quot; by revenue, despite not producing a single game. By comparison, real gaming platform holders (Sony, MS, Nintendo) negotiate all the time, and find middleground that keeps developers happy.<p>This conversation is, of course, happening every day with iOS. Nearly every app developer has a story about how Apple has slighted them. Most experience a weird review and recover from it. Some don&#x27;t. Many have similar stories concerning Google and the Play Store, but its a far less interesting narrative because there are alternatives for Android users and developers. In fact, the best selling Android devices come with an alternative store pre-installed (Galaxy), all of the first-party apps on Samsung phones are distributed and updated through there (in other words, its users use it), and you can go download Fortnite there right now.<p>So, its not the &quot;exact same&quot;. Its similar enough to where I keep an open mind, and I&#x27;m ready to join the cerebral fight for mindshare if the need for openness in consoles should occur, but I don&#x27;t feel we&#x27;re there yet. The first thing I&#x27;d need to see is actual game developers rally against a platform; maybe that isn&#x27;t happening due to fear of retribution, but I think even considering that we&#x27;d be hearing anonymous rumblings, and I&#x27;m not even hearing that."}]},{"id":25711865,"name":"jasonlotito","value":1,"text":"&gt; I think the critical component to this conversation that its important to stay focused on is not Apple&#x27;s removal of Parler, but their continued insistence on maintaining exclusive control over what people install on their devices.<p>This has been going on since the App store first launched.

Mostly because each platform ends up becoming an ideological echo chamber for the most extreme views of their founding ideology,  for the major platforms that ends up being left authoritarianism, for many of the alt-tech that ends up being right authoritarianism..<p>Since I am not authoritarian at all,  left or right, those platforms hold little interest for me and I generally avoid those places. So I can not speak to all of Trump&#x27;s tweets, though I do believe the partisan machine has generally applied the least favorable reading of all his public comments over the last several years and often time claim &quot;dog whistles&quot; far too often to the point where my general position is one of &quot;Boy who cried wolf&quot; when I see these types of comments.<p>My belief in this was reinforced by twitter&#x27;s very very weak justification for their permaban [2].  The posts they highlighted in their justification were not something I would consider to be bannable speech<p>&gt;&gt;whereas every other site removes it.<p>Which I also explained due to Parler&#x27;s very different position on what constitutes bannable speech,  they take the same position that generally favor i.e all Legal Speech should be allowed,  if a person could not be arrested and jailed for the speech then it should be permitted.<p>Now I have a feeling you also want the law to be changed to the point where people can be jailed more aggressively for their speech not simply be banned from a popular website. One of the reasons I generally oppose popular platforms banned unpopular speech is that fact that the law often follows popular opinion, thus it is popular to ban speech today it will not be long before the overton window shifts where maybe we need to water down the protections of legal speech, to the point where we are tossing people in cages for their unpopular speech.<p>As a individualist, libertarian advocating for Geo-Libertarian public policies my opinions are often viewed as unpopular,  it concerns me that we are attempting to create safe spaces and echo chambers online where no dissenting opinions are welcome, and if you say an unpopular thing you are painted as a racist, bigot, sexist or some other immoral designation.

In other words, by eating a little bit of the poison ourselves, we are granted the opportunity to save that person from their own poison, by showing compassion and empathy towards them.<p>People who have hate in their hearts are not entirely bad people. Everyone was once a child, everyone has experienced the mystery of simply existing, almost everyone has experienced love (whether from their parents or someone else), most people enjoy art and music. Evoking our shared humanity and showing compassion for others allows us to break down their toxic ideologies and even reform them to be beacons of compassion themselves.<p>Perhaps the best and most compelling anecdote to promulgate this way of thinking is Daryl Davis, who, through his talents and love of music, has reformed many of the most hateful people in our country — members of the KKK. I would recommend this TED talk by him, titled <i>&quot;Why I, as a black man, attend KKK rallies&quot;</i>: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ORp3q1Oaezw</a>. It really encapsulates the power of this viewpoint.<p>The crucial element here is ensuring that we have channels of communication that allow for this sort of compassionate understanding... I fear that the compression of thought foisted upon us by social media platforms and online communication tools obscures the basic reality of our shared suffering, joy, intrigue, and humanity. These important facets of communication can be lost to the aether of technology, and our true intentions are thereby belied by the incorrigibly weak substrate of written language.<p>As a note, I think we have discussed the topic of free speech in another thread before.

Lots of people and organizations on Twitter or Facebook had organized these events, which included looting, property damage, vandalism, assaults, arson, and more. Many politicians, such as AOC, condoned and even encouraged these events (see <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ConceptualJames&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348030442159689736\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ConceptualJames&#x2F;status&#x2F;13480304421596897...</a>).

What seems to be the clincher is the _interpretation_ and their _real world effect_. For example, Trump’s recent tweets taken collectively _and_ the effect of his supporters’ March on the capitol were starkly different than the “hang mike pence” or the women’s March (for example’s sake) that happened a few years ago on the capitol.<p>In both the latter cases, there is no credible threat of real world violence.

They are writing &quot;we banned person X because we INTERPRET Y to mean Z&quot;.

Facebook has much more problematic content in an absolute sense than Parler does, even if they have better moderation. After all, they have a far larger userbase. Parler may have a higher amount of problematic content as a percentage of all its content, but Facebook still has a large total impact. So why is their app still available?<p>The article that is linked here in the NY Times (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;technology&#x2F;apple-google-parler.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;technology&#x2F;apple-google-p...</a>) states examples of Parler deleting content encouraging violence. So it&#x27;s not as if Parler is doing zero moderation. But it is clear that Facebook and Twitter are not perfect (or even consistent) in their moderation. So where&#x27;s the threshold for when the unmoderated posts cause you to get deplatformed? That line seems arbitrary to me. It also seems like an unfair line since Parler has only 30 employees. If the response to censorship is &quot;go build your own social network&quot;, then surely there needs to be allowance for small social networks that face a sudden influx of new users and traffic. Most users of Parler, and most content, is not problematic.<p>The same question should be asked when it comes to Twitter banning Trump&#x27;s account. Twitter&#x27;s own blog post (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2020&#x2F;suspension.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2020&#x2F;suspensio...</a>) does not make a great case for proving Trump was inciting violence - certainly none of the quoted info (like Trump choosing to skip the inauguration) would pass the bar necessary for a court to prove incitement. But a more basic issue here is that the vast majority of those who turned up in DC to support Trump and see him speak did not participate in the riot. Per various sources (example <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.localdvm.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;washington-dc&#x2F;three-demonstrations-permitted-by-national-park-service-for-week-of-january-4&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.localdvm.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;washington-dc&#x2F;three-demonstrat...</a>) there were <i>tens of thousands</i> of attendees to the recent DC marches, across several fully-legal fully-permitted events. Out of all that, a few hundred raided the capitol. So if a small percentage of your followers engage in criminal activity, is that cause for a ban?

This idiotic overblown rhetoric is a propagandist trick, especially heinous after we&#x27;ve been told for months that nationwide riots that caused billions of damage and many dead and injured are &quot;mostly peaceful&quot;.<p>&gt; This is no different than when everyone was banning ISIS a few years ago.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference between American citizens protesting and ISIS. There&#x27;s also a huge difference between the service that allows people some of whom support the same politician that some of the protestors to speak and ISIS. Declaring that any service that allows people who support the same politician as anybody who commits a crime to be the same as ISIS would make everybody in the US ISIS - e.g. James T.

If you build a new phone OS, twitter and facebook can try to stop you by not writing apps for it, or possibly even detecting that a user of your hardware is trying to visit them and block the connection. Same difference.<p>When apple blocks an app for nebulous reasons (such as the hey.com debacle), that&#x27;s annoying. When google blocks an app because the authors are running a bitcoin miner or other scam, then everybody rejoices. When the microsoft phone blocks an app because it lets you screenshare to machines running linux or apple&#x27;s OS, people reach for the phone to call their lawyer or representative to start proceedings on anti-trust. When the linux phone blocks an app because they are legally obligated to do this, as a judge has informed them they are compelled to do so because the app is a marketplace for murder contracts, I think most people rejoice as well.<p>There is no absolute rule to make sense of that. It&#x27;s what society, preferably, but not neccessarily codified in law, is going to stand for. It&#x27;s not an easy rule. &quot;Prevent companies from banning anything for any reason&quot; means you end up with marketplaces for murder and viruses&#x2F;miners&#x2F;user-hostile stuff. And no cheating by allowing google to paste big warnings on an app download. Who decides what text is in that warning, and who decides which user-hostile stuff warrants this banner? Apple? We&#x27;re right back to where we started.<p>If outlawing censorship is not feasible (or it is, but you&#x27;re going to have to tell me how, because the obvious route leads to far greater problems), then the only other option I can think of is to break up these companies. Ensure there are many.<p>This also does not work. One of the better examples of this, is the internet itself: You&#x27;d think _anyone_ can host _whatever_ they want, and unless it is clearly deeply criminal, you can find somebody to host it for you. In countries with creative laws if you must.<p>Except, that&#x27;s just not how it works. There are about 8 major CDNs on the planet. If they all decide they want nothing to do with you, it is very hard to host stuff. 8kun and co run into this problem from time to time. At least one of these CDNs is acutely aware of the grave responsibility and blogs about their struggles with it. Do you allow a hate-spewing platform inciting crimes, or do you become judge jury and executioner on speech?<p>Perhaps 8 is enough, but 2 is not enough. So, if the plan is to split up these companies, how many phone platforms are legally required? How much can they work together? Should the US codify into law that it is illegal to buy an iPhone if apple&#x27;s marketshare exceeds 50% (as iOS is the most popular platform in the US, just naming as an example). Should a country find social networks and start handing out fines if too many within it use the same marketplace?<p>I get the concern, but without more detail, you&#x27;re engaging in something I find rather problematic: Pointing at an incredibly complicated problem, making a pithy statement about how bad that is, but then not naming a solution to this problem, and insinuating the solution is easy (maybe I&#x27;m imagining it, but the drama of your conclusion, whilst perhaps warranted, sure does sound like a &quot;somebody should DO something&quot; kinda claim.

Is it inflammatory? Sure. Is it a direct, actionable threat? I don&#x27;t think so, but I would certainly see it differently if a mob of Aslan&#x27;s followers showed up carrying torches. Would I have a problem with Twitter deleting the Tweet until he rephrased it to be clear that no violence was intended? No. The more civil our discourse, the more civil our society in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;m all for a very generous line on free speech to make room for very shocking or antagonizing points of views, but when your free speech encourages people to act towards violence and illegally overturning a court-upheld democratic election, I have a huge problem with that because that ultimately leads to more censorship, not less. You think AWS suspending your account and having to self-host is bad? Wait until the capitol mob destroys your business or threatens to kill you. That&#x27;s true censorship, the kind that&#x27;s so intimidating and so permanent that you don&#x27;t dare speak up. That&#x27;s the kind of censorship the capital mob was advocating for on Parler. Banning a digital account and making you create a new one somewhere else is literally the smallest, most insignificant form of censorship I can think of. And if literally no one will let you create a digital account with them, then maybe it&#x27;s you and not everyone else. Violence, intimidation and death is the censorship I&#x27;m far more worried about. Just look at how brutally effective fascists or the mob can be in censoring entire communities or schools of thought.<p>&gt; Or have we simply realized that mass censorship makes the situation even worse?<p>Let&#x27;s look at Germany who banned Mein Kampf and have &quot;mass censored&quot; the Nazi party, it&#x27;s symbols and it&#x27;s ideas. It&#x27;s not just shunned in Germany to be a Nazi or spread Nazi ideas, it&#x27;s illegal. Why does Germany believe in &quot;mass censorship&quot;? Because freedom of speech is not all or nothing and censoring Nazis pales in comparison to the alternative of letting Nazi groups freely organize. So, it&#x27;s not like this road of letting Parlor continue to allow violent political groups to coordinate an uprising leads to more freedom in the long run, it&#x27;s quite the opposite. From Germany&#x27;s experience: Want peace and freedom? Then censor those who don&#x27;t.<p>In Arnold&#x27;s recent video (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Schwarzenegger&#x2F;status&#x2F;1348249481284874240\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Schwarzenegger&#x2F;status&#x2F;134824948128487424...</a>) he talks about his father&#x27;s personal experience with slowly going along with Naziism. I&#x27;ve lived in Germany and Austria and seen the remnants of fascism and it&#x27;s horrifying. What&#x27;s even more horrifying is how easy it was for 1930&#x27;s men and women to dismiss Hitler as &quot;not that bad&quot; or &quot;yeah, he says some outrageous things, but he&#x27;d never do it&quot; or &quot;at least he&#x27;s fighting for Germany&quot; or &quot;he went a little far there, but he won&#x27;t do it again&quot; or &quot;at least Hitler&#x27;s on my side&quot; (until he isn&#x27;t). Sure, people like me might sound alarmist and maybe the capital mob fades quietly into history with no further violence, but my Austrian professor who lived through WWII talked at great length about how seamless and natural the transition from the Weimar Republic to Naziism was and this action at the capital certainly reminded me of his stories, just like it reminded Arnold of his father&#x27;s story. Giving Parler and the capital mob another shot is not the nail in the coffin for democracy, but it is another notch in violent political extremism&#x27;s tightening belt. And no one knows which notch is the final one, but when it is, there&#x27;s no room for anyone to breathe. So, instead of flirting with a violent fascist takeover we&#x27;re asking Parler&#x27;s users to please rephrase their beliefs in a non-violent way. Seems a pretty small ask.<p>Many dismiss the capital mob as lunatics, but Hitler was a 3rd rate fanatic and a recurring failure for years before he took power. In fact, the Weimar Republic wanted to work with him specifically because of how inept and easily manipulated they thought he was. Dismissing the gravity of the capital attack because it failed is a huge mistake in my opinion. Germany wasn&#x27;t a country of evil citizens who loved Naziism, it was a country of really good people who slowly went along with a few really bad people bending the norms until they had normalized the ultimate censorship: death.<p>Here we know we have a few really bad people. We don&#x27;t need to be the good people that go along with it and I&#x27;m glad that there are people in powerful positions who aren&#x27;t."}]}]}]}]},{"id":25711291,"name":"three_seagrass","value":11,"text":"If you were to end the republic without the usual mass murder (nuclear war, pandemics, etc.) How would you do it?<p>If you took out the Senate and legislature, would that work?

That is still largely protected free speech.<p>And on an even more general scale, the concept of free speech does apply to what the founding fathers were discussing leading up to and during the revolutionary war.

During the George Floyd riots in Portland, at least a few Antifa groups were using Twitter to organize their &quot;protests&quot;. If you think that Trump&#x27;s tweets were incitement, then those tweets were just as bad or even worse. Those protests didn&#x27;t result in any police&#x2F;feds dying, but a ton of police&#x2F;feds were injured, and a lot of antifa type people were trying to kill, they just weren&#x27;t very good at it.<p>But in my view, I see this idea that people are being radicalized through social media (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook) will be the same as the video games are causing violence ideas. I think what we are going to find out in the future is that allowing people to vent their crazy on the internet was more likely to let people blow off steam and wind them down. The few people who do act violently and vent about it on places like Twitter, were people who were already prone to violence. Kind of like in the video game blame game when people who were violent, the news always said that they played violent video games. In that case, those people were already violent and liked violent video games. Even those people who are &quot;radicalized&quot; by social media are probably people who could be radicalized by watching cat videos.<p>Now that&#x27;s not to say that some people who are on the fence might be radicalized by social media, but I think it&#x27;s also possible that more people are being deradicalized by allowing them to see all the things, bad or good. Of course, illegal threats should still be removed, but if these social media sites came up with a set of rules and actually followed them even when they didn&#x27;t like the person, I think that would also go a long way to calming things. Some people will still cry about getting punished unfairly, but I think it&#x27;s more likely fewer people will agree when they claim they were being persecuted when the rules are followed to the letter.<p>The biggest worry I have is that all of these deplatforming actions are actually going to lead to violence as people feel like they no longer have any way to express themselves.

The irony here - that these &quot;free speech&quot; platforms are the least able to support any kind of dissenting opinion - is intense.<p>Ultimately, the person claiming the primacy of &quot;free speech&quot; needs to accept that this freedom has a price: they need to be able to defend their position, and accept that others have alternative positions, and accept that even <i>if</i> their position is &quot;true&quot; now, it may not be &quot;true&quot; when further evidence emerges. This is rarely, I would suggest never, the case in the examples provided here.<p>In terms of this specific thread: I don&#x27;t see Parler as a &quot;platform of free speech&quot;.

That being said, there are two issues here.<p>One, is that even the staunchest free market advocates acknowledge that monopolies are constructs by which markets fail the public, and we designate trust busting as a necessary function of the state. This is yet another action in a series among many that demonstrates that not only are these companies beyond any reasonable threshold of what would historically constitute a monopoly, but that they repeatedly act in collusion with one another in service of specific objectives. These companies have the capability to effectively lock competitors out of even getting their footing. &quot;If a baker can refuse to bake a cake for a gay couple, what&#x27;s wrong with this?&quot; Well, Twitter is already an effective monopoly in its space, but Parler is created as a miniscule competitor. It has virtually no chance, but it carves out a space for itself. Well Apple and Google remove it from their marketplaces, and the apk is removed from major hosts. So now Parler needs to build its own smartphones, OSes, and marketplaces. Well now AWS says they won&#x27;t host their servers, so Parler needs to build and maintain their own server infrastructure. What&#x27;s next, credit cards refuse to process their transactions, banks refuse to serve them? You&#x27;re okay with this?<p>Secondly, do we approve of the existing monopolies doing this? Over the last few months, militant leftists have caused an estimated 5 billion in damages, taken over police stations, burned down the Minneapolis police station, attempted to burn down the federal courthouse in Portland, set up two anarchist insurrection zones which resulted in multiple murders and rapes, as well as racially segregated spaces and speaking areas, taken down century old statues of Lincoln and Grant, among others, have beat multiple business owners to within inches of their lives, destroyed countless businesses, many of which have no insurance. But this is where the buck stops? A free speech platform that hosted some of the conversations that led to a single (completely unacceptable) act by a group?

I will not be surprised if Apple and Google start censoring what websites and IP addresses you can access.
